### NICHAYATHARTHAM

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995105-05817c9d-51d6-4e24-bac7-be459e3d27e6.png)

The Nichayathartham is an engagement ceremony where the bride and the groom exchange rings on a day that is auspicious and agreed upon by their families. This is also the day when the date and time for the wedding are set (Muhuratam) by a priest who reads the Lagna Patrika. This Lagna Patrika contains all the information about both the families (their ancestors, family name etc.). The families also conduct a Ganesh pooja to invoke the Lord's blessings and exchange gifts.

### PALIGAI
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995151-292a3366-3b2d-44a4-b0b6-3d23cf65a47c.png)

Symbolic to fertility for the bride and a blessing for their descendants, the bride's and the groom's families sow seeds in the soil. These seeds are then sprinkled with water and milk by married women.

### JAANAVASAM
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995194-8fc3ab14-61f9-4f55-a82a-c7bed8f6276d.png)

This is the grand procession of the groom's party when they arrive at the mandapam for the wedding. Traditionally, the instrument of nadaswaram is played. The wedding party is welcome by the bride's family and gifts are exchanged. Later on, the bride and the groom visit a nearby temple to seek blessings.

### VRATHAM
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995242-90ca8058-37b9-4e4f-8877-b5f78fe757cd.png)

There are four ashrams in a Hindu's life - Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and Sanyasa. In this ritual, the groom seeks permission from his father to enter the next ashram of his life and break his Brahmacharya. Chanting of the mantras take place in which the bride and the groom both participate. As a mark of protection, a Rakha or Kaapu is tied on their wrists.

### KASHI YATRA
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995275-3a0a9460-e450-4955-932d-010afef54190.png)

A dramatic ritual that is very intriguing is Kashi Yatra or Kasi Yatrai. The father of the bride stops the groom who is on his way to Kashi to learn more about religion and spirituality. But when the father of the bride offers her hand to him, he stops and returns to the mandapam to get married!

### MAALAI MAATRAL
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995315-6ece3003-47b8-47c8-8dcb-5d34451e7e88.png)

The bride and groom exchange garlands overseen by their respective maternal uncles, an important figure in the hierarchy of a Hindu Family.  In the Indian tradition, a garland worn by an individual is generally not worn by another. By making an exception to the rule , the unification of two souls and oneness of the couple brought together by matrimony are highlighted.

### OONJAL
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995349-fbde992f-883a-47ad-8199-902de2746d6a.png)

Oonjal literally translates to a 'swing'. After they exchange flower garlands, they sit on a swing . The swing symbolises the vicissitudes of life which the couple is expected to face and cope with, in perfect harmony. Some families may prefer to sing traditional songs during this ceremony.

### PIDI SUTHAL
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995374-f165c9e1-da4d-4b29-8c8b-5b810bb2a4c7.png)

Five or Seven aunts with living husbands bless the couple by waving balls of white, red & yellow rice and depositing them in North, South, East and West directions. The planets and gods representing these directions are thereby propitiated. Pouring water and carrying a lighted lamp around the couple are part of the ceremony.

### KANNIKADHANAM
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995406-52fdd7ca-a775-4530-91a1-1f71ecb01459.png)

In this ritual, the bride sits on the lap of her father and is showered with gifts and blessings. This happens before the couple tie the knot where the priest places a yoke denoting harmony and coordination on the head of the bride upon a sacred grass and the Gold Mangalyam. Water is poured amidst chanting of hymns, praying for her happiness and prosperity.

### MANGALYADHARANAM
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995431-089ecca7-6cae-4e96-9edb-f4962cd5cb17.png)

The tying of the Mangal Sutra or Thali takes place at an auspicious hour. The groom ties the mangalsutra around the neck of the bride while the Nadaswaram and other instruments are played loudly to suppress any inauspicious sounds or conversations. This is called “Getting Melam”. A turmeric thread is also tied around the bride’s neck with three knots.

### PAANIGRAHANAM
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995448-4582820e-d459-4185-b2cb-545b44f2502f.png)

The groom holds the hand of the bride amidst chanting of hymns conveying that the Gods have ordained that they live as man and wife without parting and that the groom leads the life of a householder. 

### SAPTAPADI
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995473-220ed8a9-a1cd-4437-bc00-81ad723e9063.png)

Hand in hand, the groom and bride take seven steps. It signifies the wholeness of the institution of marriage. The chants indicate that each step signifies the essentials of a harmonious life viz, food, strength, wealth and prosperity, love and affection, progeny, opportune time and lasting friendship.

### AMMI MIDITHAL
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995508-d06fee7b-605a-4c04-b914-a19567ee921c.png)

The bride is made to step on a grinding stone which signifies that the bride’s mind should be rock-like, unperturbed by the trials and tribulations of life. 

### ARUNDHATI NAKSHATRAM
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995538-2ca58392-689f-4be2-b302-aadcdcbda135.png)

The groom shows the bride the double stars of Vashista and Arundhati as an ideal couple, symbolic of marital fulfilment and loyalty. The couples are asked to look up the constellation symbolizing conjugal love and affection

### NALANGU
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91045763/133995554-c9c5c38b-41cd-414d-99ff-979398f5e0e8.png)

An after-wedding ritual, Nalangu is a fun activity done majorly to help the bride and the groom talk and break the ice. Games are played, songs are sung, legs are pulled. This is an activity that is relaxing for everyone.

The  Karadayan Nolumbu(nombu)  commemorating    the epic story  of Savithri   regaining her husband from Lord Yama   is celebrated   at the last few minutes before the end of Masi(Kumbam) month  and before  the beginning  of  the month of Panguni(Meenam) .Normally   all  unmarried ladies  and married  ladies  with husbands  alive(sumangali)   offer   sweet as as well as  salt  Adai (made of rice harvested in the Kar season-May june ) , butter, banana  fruit   along with Vettilai  Pakku   to the Goddess and a yellow thread   which is offered    in the pooja   is tied by themselves or their mother in case of Unmarried ladies    and tied by the husband in case of Sumangailis   At that time they chant

 

Dhram gruhnami subhage sahardhraam
Dharami aham bharthu
Ayushya Sidhartham supreethabhava sarvadha

 

தோரம் க்ருஹ்ணாமி சுபகே ஸஹாரித்ரம் தராம்யஹம்

(I have offered  you unmelted butter    and One Adai  ,PLeae bless me so that my husband  will live with me forever)

And chant the  Dhyanam

 

Ekambara  nadha   dayithaam   kamakshim  ,

BHuvaneswarim  dhyayami  hrudaye,

தேவீம் வாஞ்சிதார்த்த ப்ரதாயிநீம்

காமாக்ஷீம் ஆவாஹயாமி.

 

 

Translation

I  meditate  on the wife of Elambara Nadha,

Who is the goddess  of the universe in my mind ,

So that  the goddess   fulfill my mind’s desires.

 

Then chant ashtothara of Kamashi   http://stotrarathna.blogspot.in/2015/06/kamakshi-ashtotharam.html and worship the goddess  by offering her flowers
It would be great if you can chant the Yamashtakam   chanted by Savithri  to  get back her husband.

Yamashtakam
(Octet addressed to Yama, the God of death)

Savithri said:-

1.Thapasaa Dharma Rajaya , pushkare Bhaskare puraa,

In the olden times Sun God got Yamuna and Dharma Raja as children,
And the Son who is the follower of Dharma , was named as king of dharma.

2.Samathaa sarva bhootheshu yasya sarvasya sakshina,
Atho yan nama samanam ithi tham pranamamyaham.

He treated every living being as equal and is the witness of everything,

At the proper time and I salute him who puts an end.

He gave punishment using his scepter to the sinners to make them pure,
I salute he who holds the scepter, who is the teacher of all duties.

Atheeva durnirvarya cha tham kaalam pranamamyaham.

Since he was swallowing the world and he always takes away all souls,
At highly exceptional circumstances and I salute that Kala.

An ascetic following the Vaishnava Dharma, one who has won over his senses,
And one who awards the results of Karma to beings is Yama and I salute him.

Paapinam klesadham yasya , puthro mithro namamyaham.

Rejoicing in his own self , one who knows all , one who is a friend of those who do good deeds,
And one who troubles sinners is the son of Sun God and I salute him.

Yo dhyayathi Param brahma Brahma vamsam namamyaham.

He took birth in the clan of Brahma and shined with effulgence of Brahmana,
And he meditates on the divine Brahmam, and I salute the clan of Brahma.

Phala Sruthi

9.Ithyukthwaa saa cha Savithri prananama Yamam Mune,
Yamasthaam Vishnu Bhajanam karmapakam uvacha ha.

Oh sage after saying this Savithri saluted that Yama,
And Yama heard her praise of Lord Vishnu due to her ripening of her JKarma.

10.Idham Yamastakam nithyam prathar uthaya padeth,
Yamath thasya bhayam Nasthi sarva paapath pramuchyathe.

If this octet on Yama is read daily as soon as one gets up in the morning,
He will have no fear of Yama and would get rid of all his sins.

11.Maha Paapi yathi paden nithyam BHakthyaa cha Narada,
Yama karothi tham shudham kaya vyuhena nischitham.

Oh Narada, if a great sinner reads it daily with devotion,
Yama will make him pure from at the time of his soul seperatring from body.

Ithi Sri Brahma Vaivartha Maha purane prakruthi khande Savithri krutha Sri yamashtakam sampoornam.
